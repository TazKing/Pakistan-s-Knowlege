<h1>What is the condition of Quaids Pakistan today</h1>
<p><i><b> Today Quaid's Pakistan is facing numerous challenges we have forgotten how much struggle the Muslims made under the dynamic leadership of Quaid e Azam Muhammad Ali Jinnah. We all are falling into disharmony and disunity dis honesty we have divided ourselves into bits and pieces.</i></b></p>


<h1><u><font color="">What we can do make Pakistan better</font></u></h1>
<p><b><i><font color=""> we can overcome our present difficulties by following Quaid's golden motto Faith Unity and DAicipline We can make our nation strong by remembering his advice to youth it is now up to you to work work work and we are bound to succeed. We should not make a difference in religion in each other. That he is Christian he is Hindu he is non-Muslim he is a Punjabi or whatever the religion he is living in Pakistan and you are also living here you both are living in the same land so you should like them, and help them. Another thing that we can do is that we should not throw garbage everywhere we should throw the Garbage in the garbage basket which is available at a little distance from each other if do this not only the garbage will be less but there will be easy for those people to clean the garbage. Another thing that we can do is we can use a few resources we should not waste our money on useless things and move to a simple life. To control air pollution we should not use smoke-producing vehicles like "Tesla".Another thing that we can do is we should now move on wheel electric vehicles so there will be no air pollution. I know all people cannot afford rupees PKR 14,950,000 for a used Tesla Model 3 to PKR 30,500,000 for a used Tesla Model 3. There are a total of 2 Tesla Cars available for sale in Pakistan on Pak Wheels. We can also that talk less and only talk about the things that we need to talk about There will be little noise pollution for example if you go into the mall you will see that there is a lot of noise every wonder is speaking very loud as to sell his pieces of stuff so we should talk less. take an example of "It war Bazar" located in "Islammad" it is open on "Sunday" and "Tuesday" in this Bazar you will find no quietness for one second. If we follow the given instruction all the problems that we are facing will not happen yes it is true.</font></i></b></p>
